============

“MoveMove” is an activity tracker app I developed on android platform. It is still a prototype. There sure are a lot of bugs and the user interface is ugly. 
I NEED your help for testing it and your comments are precious.

Here's the instruction to use it:

OPEN the app: It will automatically log into a default user I’ve set up. DON’T WORRY, press the “other user” button on the top right corner and set up YOUR OWN account!

It will start a training period after you got registered, which takes a while for you the train your app but makes your app more personalize. (More accurate in detecting activities according to your input when it ask you what you are doing)
IF YOU DON’T LIKE IT, or you believe enough training has been done, JUST click ”End my training” you will be brought to the tracking mode. Here we go!

The tracking mode give you a estimation about how much calories you have consumed today and how much exercise you still need.
＊Press home button when you want to use other apps, this will allow it running in the background.
